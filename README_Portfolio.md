Files names website_idea... are personal projects for web design. Although unfinished they represent possible creative desgins for websites (included JS/HTML/CSS files).       
Files names C50_task are assignments/ projects from a Harvard/EdX course which I took called CS50. Although these have been written in C., I could demonstrate knowledge and additional projects made in Python and SQL as well.
